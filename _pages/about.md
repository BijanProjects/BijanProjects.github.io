Hi, I’m Bijan. I am currently in the final semester of my Master’s in Computer Engineering at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. My thesis focuses on applying deep learning algorithms to detect motor imagery commands.

I specialize in applied machine learning, with extensive experience in both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. I utilize a combination of deep learning and classical machine learning techniques to solve complex problems. Recently, my research has centered around NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I’m passionate about continuous learning and thrive in environments that challenge me to grow. I approach every project with curiosity and a strong commitment to expanding my knowledge.
