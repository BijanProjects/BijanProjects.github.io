excerpt: 'This paper was part of my bachelor’s project at K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in conjunction with an internship at the LIVIA Lab, École de technologie supérieure (ETS), Montreal, Canada. The research focused on using machine learning to predict long-term mortality in patients who had experienced acute myocardial infarction (AMI). By incorporating advanced algorithms like random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, along with novel biomarkers such as the brachial pre-ejection period (bPEP) and brachial ejection time (bET), we aimed to improve the accuracy of these predictions. The findings suggest that adding these biomarkers significantly boosted the performance of the models, helping identify high-risk patients for better monitoring and treatment.'
